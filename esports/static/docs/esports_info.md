# __Esports in High Schools: Statistics, Benefits, Risks, and Rewards__
Deep research provided by Google Gemini: Updated - Apr 17 2025

## __1. Introduction__


### __The Burgeoning Landscape of Esports in High School Education__

Esports, or competitive video gaming, has rapidly evolved from a peripheral pastime to a mainstream extracurricular activity within the educational sphere of the United States.<sup>1</sup> This expansion signifies a growing recognition of the potential value that diverse extracurricular pursuits hold in the holistic development of high school students. The swiftness with which esports programs are being adopted across the nation suggests a significant level of student interest and a potential paradigm shift in how educational institutions perceive the role and legitimacy of competitive gaming within their environments.


### __The Need for a Data-Driven Understanding of Its Implications__

For schools to effectively integrate esports into their existing frameworks, a robust understanding grounded in empirical evidence is crucial. Stakeholders, including administrators, educators, parents, and students, require data-backed insights into both the advantages and disadvantages associated with participation [User Query]. Relying solely on anecdotal accounts is insufficient for making well-informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources, the design of program curricula, and the establishment of supportive policies.


### __Report Objectives and Scope__

This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of esports at the high school level in the US. It will delve into the available statistics regarding its prevalence and participation rates, meticulously examine the data-supported benefits across academic and social domains, critically assess the potential risks encompassing health and financial aspects, and explore the rewards and opportunities that esports can offer to high school students. The scope of this analysis will encompass the impact on academic performance, the development of social skills, considerations for physical and mental well-being, the financial implications for schools and families, and the potential pathways to future educational and professional opportunities.


## __2. The Growth and Participation in High School Esports__


### __Statistics on the Number of US High Schools with Esports Programs__

Several organizations track the burgeoning presence of esports within United States high schools, and their data collectively illustrates a significant and expanding landscape. The Network of Academic and Scholastic Esports Federation (NASEF) currently counts approximately 3,500 high school esports clubs operating across all 50 states.<sup>1</sup> It is important to note that this figure does not include those programs that function independently or under the auspices of other state or national organizations.<sup>1</sup>

The High School Esports League (HSEL), another prominent entity in this space, governs the esports activities of more than 3,100 schools.<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, the Interstate Scholastic Esports Alliance (ISEA), a coalition of educator-run scholastic esports organizations, comprises over 2,000 schools and 65,000 students across its 12 member leagues.<sup>3</sup>

The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) officially recognized esports as a sport in 2018. Since this pivotal moment, the growth has been substantial, with more than 8,600 high schools having initiated video-gaming teams.<sup>4</sup> The varying figures reported by these organizations likely stem from differences in their membership criteria, reporting methodologies, or the inclusion of independently operated programs versus those formally affiliated with a specific league or federation. This discrepancy underscores the potential need for a standardized definition and tracking system to provide a more unified understanding of the high school esports ecosystem.


### __Data on Student Participation Rates Across Different Leagues and Teams__

Data on student participation rates further underscores the significant engagement in high school esports. According to the latest participation survey by the NFHS, released in September, esports participation spans 22 states, with more than 27,000 boys and 4,000 girls actively competing.<sup>3</sup> This represents an increase of more than 3,000 students compared to the previous year.<sup>3</sup> The NFHS survey for the 2023-24 school year indicated a total of 27,051 participants in high school esports, comprising 23,041 boys and 4,010 girls, marking an increase of 3,129 participants from the year before.<sup>5</sup>

HSEL reports an even larger reach, involving over 100,000 students in its seasonal tournaments.<sup>3</sup> ISEA also accounts for a substantial number of participants, with 65,000 students across its member leagues.<sup>3</sup> To illustrate the popularity within individual schools, Gretna High School boasts approximately 150 student participants in its esports program, which constitutes roughly 10 percent of the entire student body, making it the largest sports team in the school.<sup>4</sup>

Broader surveys of teenage gaming habits provide additional context. A Pew Research Center survey revealed that a significant majority, 85 percent, of teens in the United States play video games, with 41 percent reporting that they play at least once a day.<sup>6</sup> The NFHS 2022-23 survey specifically captured data on esports participation, noting 20,001 boys and 3,921 girls involved in competitive gaming within their schools.<sup>6</sup>

Interestingly, survey data from several school districts indicates that esports is attracting a significant segment of the student population that was not previously engaged in other forms of extracurricular activities. For instance, in the Grapevine-Colleyville district, 70 percent of esports participants were new to extracurricular involvement. Similarly, Albuquerque reported 55 percent, and Moreno Valley noted 60 percent of their esports students had not participated in other school-sponsored activities.<sup>6</sup> This trend suggests that esports is successfully reaching and engaging students who might otherwise remain on the sidelines, fulfilling a unique role in the extracurricular landscape. It is also evident that a notable gender disparity exists in participation, with a considerably higher number of boys involved in high school esports compared to girls. This highlights a potential area for focused efforts to promote greater female engagement and inclusivity within these programs.


### __Trends in the Growth of Esports at the High School Level__

The growth of esports programs in US high schools has been particularly pronounced since the NFHS officially recognized it as a sport in 2018.<sup>4</sup> This recognition likely provided legitimacy and encouraged more schools to consider establishing teams. The global esports market is also experiencing exponential growth, with projections indicating a revenue of $9.2 billion by 2032.<sup>8</sup> This robust growth in the professional and amateur esports scene likely fuels the increasing interest and participation at the high school level.

Furthermore, some school districts are now expanding their esports initiatives to include middle school programs.<sup>9</sup> This trend suggests a strategic approach to building a developmental pipeline for esports talent and capitalizing on the potential benefits of engaging students with competitive gaming at an earlier age. The expansion into younger grades mirrors the approach taken with traditional sports, where junior varsity and feeder programs are common. The sustained growth trajectory of high school esports closely reflects the overall expansion of the global esports market, indicating a strong external influence and suggesting that this trend is likely to continue in the foreseeable future.

## __3. Academic Benefits: Examining the Data__


### __Analysis of Research Linking Esports Participation to Improved GPA__

Several studies and reports have begun to explore the relationship between participation in high school esports programs and academic performance, with a particular focus on grade point averages (GPA). Research conducted in 2023 indicated that students involved in esports exhibited improved attendance, attending an average of 7.34 additional school days and demonstrating a 19.3 percent lower absentee rate compared to their non-participating peers.<sup>10</sup> Notably, over 60 percent of these esports participants had not been involved in any extracurricular activities prior to joining the esports program, and some students even experienced an increase in their GPAs.<sup>10</sup>

Further evidence from the 2022-23 school year in one district revealed positive correlations between esports participation and higher scores on state standardized tests in English/language arts and mathematics.<sup>6</sup> While this suggests a potential link between esports and academic achievement, it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and further research is needed to fully understand this relationship.

Interestingly, a study focusing on collegiate esports found no negative correlation between a student's GPA and the amount of time they spent playing esports.<sup>11</sup> In fact, some students who dedicated significant hours to gaming still maintained high GPAs.<sup>11</sup> This suggests that with effective time management and dedication, high-level gaming and academic success may not be mutually exclusive. Similarly, research has indicated that participation in collegiate esports teams may contribute to an increase in overall GPAs.<sup>12</sup>

A study comparing esports student-athletes with student gamers found that both groups achieved the same average GPA of 3.23, despite esports athletes reporting a higher number of study hours.<sup>13</sup> This indicates that while the behaviors and time allocation may differ, the academic outcomes can be similar. Testimonials from educators in high schools with esports programs suggest that students often become more attentive to their grades as maintaining academic eligibility is a requirement for participation.<sup>14</sup>

However, not all research has yielded conclusive positive results. One study specifically designed to examine the impact of an esports extracurricular program on academic performance and attendance found the data collected to be inconclusive in supporting claims of increased GPA.<sup>15</sup> Despite this, testimonials from administrators, teachers, students, and parents involved in the program suggested an increase in students' motivation in school.<sup>15</sup> This highlights the possibility that the academic benefits of esports might be indirect, potentially stemming from increased engagement and motivation rather than a direct impact on grades themselves. The varied findings across different studies underscore the complexity of the relationship between esports participation and academic outcomes, suggesting that factors such as program structure, student demographics, and the intensity of involvement likely play significant roles. More rigorous, large-scale studies are needed to establish a clearer understanding of this connection.


### __Data-Backed Outcomes on the Impact of Esports on Student Attendance__

A compelling body of evidence suggests a positive correlation between participation in esports and improved student attendance rates. Esports-driven curriculums have been proposed as an innovative solution to address the persistent issue of chronic absenteeism by leveraging students' passion for gaming to enhance their engagement with school.<sup>16</sup> A study conducted in a California school district revealed that students participating in esports had a significantly lower absence rate, 33.5 percent lower, compared to their non-participating peers.<sup>16</sup> On average, esports participants in this study attended school 7.34 more days than non-participants, which also resulted in an additional $354,000 in school funding based on Average Daily Attendance (ADA).<sup>16</sup>

Another study conducted in Moreno Valley also found a substantial reduction in absenteeism among esports players, reporting a 19.3 percent lower absence rate compared to students who did not participate in esports.<sup>18</sup> Furthermore, an esports league reported that its participants attended school an average of one to two more days during a two-week period after joining the team, with a remarkable 80 percent of participants stating they were more likely to come to school specifically because of esports.<sup>18</sup>

Generation Esports, an organization promoting scholastic gaming, has reported that schools incorporating their Gaming Concepts curriculum have experienced up to a 10 percent increase in student attendance, which directly helps address the pervasive problem of chronic absenteeism.<sup>19</sup> Data from PlayVS, a leading esports platform for high schools, indicates that 45 percent of their student users reported feeling more excited about attending school after joining an esports team.<sup>20</sup> This collective data strongly suggests that esports can serve as a powerful motivator for students to attend school more regularly, potentially by providing a sense of purpose, belonging, and an engaging activity that they look forward to. The consistency of these findings across various studies and reports highlights the potential of esports as a valuable tool for improving student engagement and reducing chronic absenteeism in high schools.


### __Studies Exploring the Correlation Between Esports and Standardized Test Scores__

While the data linking high school esports participation to improved GPA is still developing, some evidence suggests a potential positive correlation with standardized test scores. Data from Albuquerque indicated a connection between student involvement in esports and higher scores on state standardized tests in English/language arts and mathematics during the 2022-23 school year.<sup>6</sup> This finding hints at the possibility that the cognitive skills and engagement fostered through esports may have a broader impact on academic performance, extending to standardized assessments.

Furthermore, research on the benefits of extracurricular activities in general, which would include esports, has found that students who participate in such activities tend to perform higher on math and reading assessments.<sup>21</sup> This broader trend suggests that the positive effects of extracurricular involvement, such as increased engagement and the development of cognitive skills, may contribute to improved performance in academic subjects assessed by standardized tests. However, it is important to acknowledge that the direct evidence specifically linking esports to higher standardized test scores is less extensive compared to the data on attendance. The correlation found in the Albuquerque district needs to be further investigated and replicated in different contexts to determine its generalizability and to better understand the underlying mechanisms through which esports might influence test performance. More research is needed to establish a clear causal link and to fully elucidate the relationship between high school esports participation and standardized test outcomes.

## __4. Social Benefits: Evidence of Enhanced Skills and Community__


### __Research Quantifying the Development of Teamwork and Collaboration Through Esports__

A significant body of research and anecdotal evidence highlights the role of esports in fostering crucial social skills, particularly teamwork and collaboration, among high school students. The very nature of most competitive esports titles demands a high degree of cooperation, communication, strategic planning, and coordination among team members to achieve success.<sup>8</sup> Like traditional team sports, esports requires players to work together towards a common objective, often involving intricate strategies and the need for rapid, collective decision-making.<sup>14</sup>

Team-based video games inherently challenge players to engage in critical thinking and collaboratively resolve complex problems that arise during gameplay.<sup>24</sup> For example, in games like Overwatch, success is heavily reliant on constant communication, clearly defined roles for each player, and seamless teamwork to coordinate offensive and defensive maneuvers.<sup>25</sup> Esports environments promote collective strategic thinking, requiring teams to develop and adapt their game plans based on the evolving circumstances of each match. This process necessitates negotiation among team members, delegation of tasks, and mutual support to achieve a unified objective.<sup>26</sup>

Coaches involved in high school esports programs have observed tangible improvements in their players' social interactions and collaborative abilities. Surveys have indicated that a significant majority of esports coaches, around 90 percent, have witnessed improved socialization among their players, and 85 percent have noted an enhancement in their communication skills.<sup>20</sup> This suggests that the structured and competitive environment of esports provides a valuable platform for students to hone their abilities to work effectively as part of a team. The parallels between the teamwork and collaboration required in esports and traditional sports are striking, indicating that competitive gaming can offer similar benefits in terms of developing these essential life skills.


### __Data Demonstrating the Improvement of Communication Skills Among Student Players__

Effective communication serves as the linchpin of success in the fast-paced and dynamic world of esports, where split-second decisions and synchronized actions can often determine the outcome of a match.<sup>27</sup> Games such as Valorant, Rocket League, Call of Duty, and Rainbow Six Siege necessitate clear and concise communication between teammates for planning strategies, sharing crucial real-time information about the game state, and adapting to ever-changing in-game scenarios.<sup>27</sup>

Research has shown that participation in esports can lead to tangible improvements in students' communication abilities. For instance, a survey revealed that 38 percent of students reported communicating better with their peers as a direct result of their involvement in esports.<sup>20</sup> Esports provides numerous opportunities for students to sharpen their communication skills, mastering the art of expressing themselves efficiently and assertively within the context of gameplay.<sup>27</sup> The need for clear and concise communication under pressure in esports hones players' ability to articulate their thoughts quickly and effectively.<sup>28</sup>

Furthermore, esports encourages teenagers to engage in real-time communication, both verbal and written, to strategize and execute game plans collaboratively.<sup>28</sup> Through constant interaction with teammates, they develop the ability to convey their ideas clearly, actively listen to the input of others, and contribute to collective decision-making processes.<sup>28</sup> In many esports competitions, leadership roles emerge, requiring individuals to step up and make critical decisions while directing the team during intense gameplay. Successful leaders in this context must possess strong communication skills to provide clear direction, offer constructive feedback, and keep their teammates focused and motivated.<sup>28</sup> This practical application of communication skills within the competitive gaming environment helps teenagers develop a robust foundation that extends beyond the digital realm, positively impacting their personal and professional relationships in the future.


### __Evidence of Esports Fostering a Stronger Sense of Community and Belonging__

One of the significant social benefits of esports in high schools is its ability to foster a strong sense of community and belonging among students, particularly those who may not find these connections through traditional avenues. Esports provides an ideal opportunity for students who may not be interested in traditional athletics to nonetheless be part of a team and learn valuable skills in a supportive environment.<sup>22</sup> It offers a unique platform for building connections across diverse student populations, promoting inclusivity and breaking down social barriers.<sup>22</sup>

Surveys of students participating in esports programs reveal the positive impact on their sense of community. A study found that 57 percent of students reported that esports makes them feel like they are part of a community, and 46 percent indicated that they have made more friends through their involvement in esports.<sup>20</sup> Furthermore, a significant 84 percent of players in one league's initial season reported that they had finally found a community where they could truly connect with others.<sup>21</sup>

Esports programs in schools can effectively reach students who might otherwise be disengaged from the school community, transporting them from the often solitary world of individual digital gaming into the shared space of a school computer lab or library commons.<sup>22</sup> Data from school districts has shown that a notable percentage of students participating in esports were not involved in any other school-sponsored activities prior to joining the team.<sup>6</sup> This suggests that esports is providing a sense of belonging and connection for students who may have previously felt isolated or on the periphery of school life. By creating an inclusive environment centered around a shared passion for gaming, high school esports programs are helping to build a stronger sense of community and foster valuable social connections among a diverse range of students.

## __5. Potential Risks: A Data-Informed Perspective__


### __Studies Presenting Data on Physical Health Concerns (Eye Strain, Sedentary Behavior, etc.)__

Research has identified several potential physical health concerns associated with participation in esports at the high school level. Due to the nature of competitive gaming, which involves prolonged periods of sitting and intense focus on screens, esports is often linked to a sedentary lifestyle.<sup>37</sup> This lack of physical activity can contribute to various health issues over time. Maintaining poor posture for extended gaming sessions can lead to musculoskeletal problems, including neck pain, back pain, and other postural injuries, sometimes referred to as "gamer neck".<sup>37</sup>

The intense visual focus required in esports can also result in ocular fatigue, eye strain, and even vision problems.<sup>37</sup> Headaches are another commonly reported physical complaint related to prolonged screen time.<sup>39</sup> Irregular sleep patterns and the tendency to game late into the night can disrupt adolescents' sleep cycles, leading to sleep problems, fatigue, and even insomnia.<sup>37</sup> Dehydration is another potential risk, as players can become so engrossed in their games that they forget to drink adequate fluids.<sup>39</sup>

Furthermore, studies have indicated that a significant majority of esports players do not engage in sufficient physical exercise.<sup>40</sup> One study found that only 19.7 percent of esports players meet the recommendation of at least 30 minutes of exercise five days a week.<sup>40</sup> This lack of physical activity can increase the risk of decreased cerebral blood flow, cardiovascular diseases, and may even contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression.<sup>40</sup> Research on collegiate esports athletes showed that a concerning 40 percent reported not participating in any other form of physical activity outside of gaming.<sup>38</sup> These findings underscore the importance of raising awareness about the potential physical health risks associated with prolonged and sedentary esports participation and implementing strategies within high school programs to encourage healthy habits and mitigate these concerns.


### __Research and Statistics Related to Mental Health Considerations (Stress, Addiction)__

Beyond the physical health risks, participation in high school esports can also present mental health considerations that warrant careful attention. The competitive nature of esports, coupled with the potential for exposure to online toxicity, can contribute to increased levels of stress, anxiety, and even depression among players.<sup>34</sup> Research has indicated that gaming daily, particularly for more than six hours, is associated with lower psychological well-being in adolescents.<sup>37</sup> Additionally, having a strong interest in pursuing a professional esports career has been linked to lower psychological well-being in young people.<sup>37</sup>

Studies focusing on elite esports players have revealed a high prevalence of anxiety, with one study reporting it in 82 percent of participants, as well as issues with burnout.<sup>42</sup> Alarmingly, 68.6 percent of these elite players reported a lack of access to mental health support.<sup>42</sup> The significant amount of screen time and sedentary behavior inherent in esports participation may also exacerbate existing mental health symptoms compared to athletes in more physically active sports.<sup>43</sup>

Gaming addiction, also known as Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD), is a significant concern within the esports community. Studies have shown varying prevalence rates of IGD among adolescents, ranging from just over 3 percent to over 10 percent in different populations.<sup>7</sup> One study focusing on 13-19 year olds found a prevalence rate of 10.6 percent.<sup>46</sup> Factors such as spending a significant amount of time gaming daily, particularly on weekdays, having poor relationships with parents, and using gaming as an escape mechanism have been associated with a higher risk of IGD.<sup>48</sup> The potential for addiction to negatively impact academic performance, social skills, and overall well-being underscores the importance of awareness, education, and support systems within high school esports programs to address these mental health considerations proactively.


### __Analysis of the Financial Implications of Establishing and Running Esports Programs__

The financial implications of establishing and maintaining esports programs in high schools are a significant consideration for administrators and school boards. While the costs can vary depending on the scope and ambition of the program, they often compare favorably to those associated with traditional sports. Startup costs for collegiate esports programs can range widely, from $8,000 to as much as $300,000 or even more for institutions investing in dedicated, state-of-the-art facilities.<sup>54</sup> The average startup expense for a college program has been estimated at around $41,000.<sup>55</sup>

However, the financial outlay for high school esports programs can be considerably lower, particularly if schools can leverage existing technology infrastructure and if students already own personal computers or gaming consoles.<sup>56</sup> A basic esports setup capable of running most competitive games can be acquired for approximately $1,000, with more advanced gaming computers available for around $2,500.<sup>56</sup> Exploring the option of purchasing refurbished equipment can further reduce costs, with complete esports-ready computer setups for a team potentially costing under $5,000.<sup>57</sup>

The ongoing costs associated with running an esports program typically include the initial investment in gaming equipment, potential stipends for coaches, software licenses, and ensuring adequate internet bandwidth and infrastructure.<sup>58</sup> Some programs may also consider investing in insurance to protect their equipment from damage or theft.<sup>58</sup> In contrast to many traditional sports, esports programs often incur minimal travel expenses, as competitions frequently take place online or at local venues.<sup>56</sup> This can represent a significant cost saving for schools. Overall, while initial investment is required, the financial commitment for establishing and running a high school esports program can be quite manageable, especially when compared to the often substantial budgets required for traditional athletic teams. This accessibility can make esports a viable option for schools looking to expand their extracurricular offerings without incurring prohibitive costs.

## __6. Rewards and Opportunities: Data on Scholarships and Careers__


### __Statistics on the Availability and Value of College Esports Scholarships__

The landscape of college esports scholarships has witnessed significant growth in recent years, presenting a valuable reward for talented high school esports players who aspire to continue their gaming careers while pursuing higher education. In the past year alone, US colleges awarded over $16 million in esports scholarships.<sup>4</sup> This represents a substantial increase from the $8 million awarded in the 2020/2021 academic year, indicating a clear trend of growing financial support for collegiate esports.<sup>61</sup>

Currently, hundreds of colleges and universities across the United States have established varsity esports programs and are actively supporting their teams with scholarship opportunities.<sup>62</sup> The National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE) plays a central role in this ecosystem, with over 250 member institutions that offer competitive gaming programs.<sup>3</sup>

The value of these esports scholarships can vary considerably, ranging from partial awards of $500 to more substantial scholarships worth up to $10,000 annually.<sup>64</sup> Some institutions even offer full-ride scholarships to exceptionally skilled esports athletes.<sup>64</sup> The average scholarship award for varsity and junior varsity esports team members is typically around $2,000 per year.<sup>64</sup> Furthermore, organizations like the High School Esports League (HSEL) have directly contributed to this financial support, having distributed over $700,000 in scholarships to talented high school players.<sup>62</sup> This increasing availability and value of college esports scholarships provide a tangible and significant incentive for high school students to develop their gaming skills and consider pursuing esports at the collegiate level.


### __Data on the Number of Students Receiving Esports Scholarships__

While the total amount of esports scholarship money awarded by colleges is a significant indicator of the financial opportunities available, specific data on the exact number of high school students who successfully receive these scholarships annually is less readily available in the provided information. However, the consistent growth in both the number of collegiate esports programs and the total amount of scholarship funds being offered strongly suggests a corresponding increase in the number of high school students benefiting from this financial aid.

A survey conducted among small colleges with established esports programs provided some insight, reporting a median of 10 students being enrolled either partially or entirely due to their esports abilities in the program's initial year of operation.<sup>66</sup> This indicates that even smaller programs are actively recruiting and financially supporting student gamers. To illustrate this at the high school level, Lyons Township High School in suburban Chicago reported sending four of their students to college with esports scholarships in a single year.<sup>4</sup> Although a comprehensive national figure for the number of high school students receiving esports scholarships each year is not explicitly stated in the provided snippets, the increasing investment in collegiate esports, coupled with examples of high schools successfully placing students with scholarships, suggests a growing trend of talented high school gamers leveraging their skills to access financial support for their college education.


### __Exploration of Career Pathways Emerging from High School Esports, Supported by Industry Data__

Participation in high school esports can serve as a springboard for a diverse range of career pathways, both within the rapidly expanding esports industry itself and in related fields that value the skills developed through competitive gaming.<sup>22</sup> Esports programs cultivate a variety of transferable skills that are highly valued in today's job market, including teamwork, problem-solving, strategic thinking, communication, and technical proficiency.<sup>22</sup>

Within the gaming industry, several distinct career paths are emerging for individuals with a passion for esports. These include becoming a professional gamer, esports coach, game developer, event manager, esports broadcaster (shoutcaster), and various roles in content creation.<sup>67</sup> Beyond directly playing games, the esports ecosystem also offers opportunities in areas such as esports team management, marketing, and esports journalism.<sup>67</sup>

The skills honed through esports participation are also highly relevant to careers outside the gaming industry. These include fields such as software engineering, graphic design, marketing, cybersecurity, information technology (IT) support, data analysis, and even event planning.<sup>67</sup> The global esports market is experiencing substantial growth, with projections indicating a market size of $2.07 billion by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.0%.<sup>80</sup> Other sources indicate the global market surpassed $1.5 billion in annual revenue in 2023.<sup>81</sup> This rapid expansion is creating a growing demand for skilled professionals across various roles within the esports ecosystem.<sup>77</sup> Job openings in the esports sector nearly doubled from 2018 to 2019, with the United States leading in the number of available positions.<sup>85</sup>

The earning potential in esports-related careers can be significant. Salaries can range from approximately $51,000 per year for IT support specialists to over $114,000 annually for entry-level data scientists.<sup>70</sup> Professional gamers at the highest levels can potentially earn significantly more, with some earning salaries in the range of $80,000 to $149,000 annually.<sup>77</sup> The diverse range of career opportunities and the substantial growth of the esports industry highlight the potential for high school esports participation to provide students with valuable skills and pathways to future educational and professional success.

## __7. Comparative Analysis: Benefits vs. Risks in High School Esports__


### __A Data-Driven Comparison of the Identified Benefits and Risks__

The data gathered on high school esports reveals a compelling mix of benefits and risks that warrant careful consideration. Strong evidence supports the notion that esports participation leads to increased student engagement and improved attendance rates, suggesting a powerful tool for connecting with students who might otherwise be disengaged from school.<sup>6</sup> Furthermore, the social advantages appear substantial, with research and surveys indicating improvements in teamwork, communication skills, and a stronger sense of community and belonging among student players.<sup>20</sup> While the academic benefits, particularly in terms of direct impact on GPA and standardized test scores, are less definitively established, some studies point to positive correlations, potentially mediated by the increased engagement and motivation that esports fosters.<sup>6</sup>

On the other side of the equation, the primary risks associated with high school esports participation revolve around physical and mental health. The sedentary nature of competitive gaming raises concerns about issues such as eye strain, postural problems, and insufficient physical activity.<sup>37</sup> Mental health considerations include increased stress, anxiety, and a potential risk of developing gaming disorder, particularly with excessive play and aspirations for professional gaming careers.<sup>7</sup> From a financial perspective, the costs associated with establishing and running high school esports programs appear to be manageable for many schools, especially when compared to the often higher expenses of traditional sports programs.<sup>54</sup> Finally, the rewards of participating in high school esports are becoming increasingly significant, with a growing number of college scholarship opportunities available to talented players and a diverse array of potential career paths emerging within the rapidly expanding esports industry and related technology and business sectors.<sup>4</sup>


### __Discussion on the Balance Between Positive and Negative Outcomes Based on Current Research__

The balance between the positive and negative outcomes of high school esports participation seems to be significantly influenced by the way in which these programs are structured and the level of support they receive within the school environment. When esports programs are implemented thoughtfully, with adult supervision, a strong emphasis on promoting healthy habits, and a proactive approach to addressing potential mental health concerns, the likelihood of maximizing the benefits and mitigating the risks is considerably higher.<sup>37</sup>

The consistently high rates of student engagement in esports, coupled with its ability to attract students who were previously disengaged from traditional extracurricular activities, suggests a significant positive impact on overall school culture and the well-being of a specific segment of the student population.<sup>6</sup> The increasing availability of college scholarships and the emergence of diverse career opportunities within the esports ecosystem provide compelling incentives for students to participate and for schools to consider investing in these programs.<sup>4</sup> Considering the weight of the evidence for each of the benefits and risks, and acknowledging the crucial role of program structure and support, a balanced perspective emerges. This perspective suggests that when implemented with careful consideration and appropriate safeguards to address health and well-being concerns, high school esports can indeed be a valuable and enriching addition to the educational landscape.


## __8. Conclusion and Recommendations__


### __Synthesis of Key Data Points and Insights__

The analysis of available data and research indicates that esports at the high school level is a rapidly growing phenomenon, attracting a significant and diverse group of students, including many who were not previously involved in other extracurricular activities. The evidence strongly supports the positive impact of esports participation on student attendance and the development of crucial social skills such as teamwork, communication, and a sense of community. While the academic benefits, particularly regarding direct improvements in GPA and standardized test scores, require further investigation, there are promising correlations that suggest a potential positive influence, possibly mediated by increased student engagement and motivation.

The primary risks associated with high school esports relate to the potential negative impacts on physical and mental health due to the sedentary nature of gaming, prolonged screen time, and the risk of addiction and stress. However, these risks can be mitigated through proactive program design and student education. Importantly, the rewards and opportunities associated with high school esports are becoming increasingly substantial, with a growing number of college scholarship opportunities available to talented players and a wide array of career paths emerging within the burgeoning esports industry and related fields.


### __Recommendations for Stakeholders (Schools, Parents, Students) Based on the Evidence Presented__

__Schools:__



* Consider the implementation of esports programs as a viable strategy to enhance student engagement, offer diverse extracurricular opportunities, and cater to the interests of a broad range of students.
* Develop comprehensive program guidelines that prioritize the well-being of student participants, including mandatory breaks during gaming sessions, educational initiatives on healthy gaming habits, and readily accessible resources for mental health support.

* Actively inform students and their parents about the growing opportunities for college scholarships and diverse career pathways that are directly linked to participation in esports.
* Foster an inclusive environment within esports programs to encourage participation from all students, regardless of their gender, background, or prior experience with competitive gaming.
* Where appropriate, explore opportunities to integrate esports-related concepts and skills into the academic curriculum, particularly in areas such as STEM, communication, and technology.

__Parents:__



* Support their children's interest in esports while actively encouraging a balanced lifestyle that includes regular physical activity, meaningful face-to-face social interaction, and a strong commitment to their academic responsibilities.
* Educate themselves about the potential benefits and risks associated with esports participation and engage in open and ongoing communication with their children regarding their involvement in competitive gaming.
* Collaborate with schools and esports coaches to ensure a healthy, supportive, and structured environment for their children's participation in esports programs.

__Students:__



* Engage in esports responsibly, ensuring that it remains a balanced part of their lives alongside their academic pursuits, physical activity, and social interactions with friends and family.
* Be keenly aware of the potential physical and mental health risks associated with prolonged gaming and take proactive steps to mitigate these risks, such as taking regular breaks, maintaining proper posture, ensuring adequate hydration, and prioritizing sleep.
* Actively apply the teamwork, communication, and strategic thinking skills learned through esports to other aspects of their academic, social, and personal lives.
* Explore the increasing opportunities for scholarships at the college level and the diverse range of career paths that are emerging within the esports ecosystem and related industries.

A collaborative and informed approach involving schools, parents, and students is essential for effectively maximizing the numerous benefits that high school esports can offer while proactively minimizing the potential risks. By working together, stakeholders can create a positive and supportive environment that allows students to thrive both in the digital arena and in their broader educational and personal development.
